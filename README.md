### TF-IDF implementation using Spark with Scala 
[link to code](https://github.com/Kudryavets/tf-idf-spark-scala)

This is implementation of [TF-IDF algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) with only RDD API. It aims to show several basic optimizations which can be done in the first place. These optimizations are:
* amount of shuffles is reduced to 1
* efficient aggregation introduced for inverted index construction
* all distributed variables are created in memory saving way
* Kryo serialization is used instead of Java serialization
